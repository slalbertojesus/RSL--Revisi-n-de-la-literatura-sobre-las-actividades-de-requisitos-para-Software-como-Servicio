        abstract = {Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in business organizations aims to integrate all business units of an organization. Configuring and customizing ERP systems are the main challenges that face the implementation process. ERP systems contain many similar modules and units which can be implemented for most of the ERP systems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) as a trend in software engineering is very promising, as it can offer a lot of facilities and benefits for all types of stakeholders. Building SPLs for ERP systems will affect the implementation process of ERP systems and will increase the flexibility of configuration and customization. Moreover, moving ERPs to the cloud will facilitate the implementation process and will affect the Return On Investment (ROI) due to scalability plans in cloud services. This research introduces an SPLs requirements elicitation approach for cloud ERP systems. This approach combines the principles of SPLs with ERP systems in the cloud environment.},

Software-as-a-Service should be provided in single code base and operated as a single instance. To meet these constraints and requirements from various customers, Software-as-a-Service must be highly configurable. To develop configurable Software-as-a-Service, it is important to elicit and analyze configuration requirements in the early stages of development. Another issue is that on implementing configuration requirements, there are duplicated and untidy code segments. In our study, configuration requirements are identified and classified. This study introduces design patterns to remove duplicated codes for configuration.},

The framework is based on decomposing strategic goals into tactical and operational IT goals adopting a multiple perspectives elicitation approach that facilitates business-IT alignment in the elicitation/mapping of the service requirements and in the choice of the target service offerings. The framework is applicable in a scenario where there is a marketplace of software service providers (e.g. ASP's or web service yellow pages) and the sourcing organization is interested in developing service requirements and searching for services available in the marketplace that are aligned with the organizational goals. The framework is supported by a tool that helps the requirements analyst in the process of developing multiple perspectives service goal trees and also in the process of matching service goals to keywords describing service offerings available in the e-Service marketplace.},
